# Blinkit_Dataset_Analysis

This project analyzes the Blinkit dataset using Python to fulfill specific business and KPI requirements through data visualization. The analysis focuses on understanding sales performance, product characteristics, customer ratings, and outlet-level trends. A structured approach was followed to ensure the dataset was clean, reliable, and suitable for analysis.

The workflow began by creating a Pandas DataFrame to efficiently work with the data. During exploration, inconsistent entries in the Item Fat Content field were identified and corrected, improving data quality. Once cleaned, the analysis proceeded to address each business requirement outlined in the presentation, ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout the process.

Insights were derived primarily through visual analysis using Matplotlib (pyplot) and Seaborn, with visualizations including pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs. These visuals were used to evaluate total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings across different product and outlet segments. The final output is a well-structured, analysis-ready dataset supported by clear and meaningful visual insights..
